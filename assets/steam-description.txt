[h1]Overview[/h1]
Wish that your empire's Ruler jobs were a little bit more varied than just endless Politicians?  Then this mod is for you!

Similar to how the Merchant Guilds, Exalted Priesthood, Aristocratic Elite, and Technocracy civics swap some Politician jobs out for their relevant jobs, capital buildings for regular, [b]non-[/b]MegaCorp empires will now [i]also[/i] swap out some Politician jobs based on the planet's colony designation:
[list]
[*]Trade-related colonies will swap for Merchants
[*]Unity-related colonies will swap for High Priests (spiritualist empires) or Nobles (Aristocratic Elite, imperial authorities, or the Galactic Emperor)
[*]Research-related colonies will swap for Science Directors
[/list]
These swaps combine with those for the leader-swap civics, so that some planets may end up with no Politicians at all.

[h1]Changes[/h1]
Replaces five of the built-in capital buildings: [b]building_capital[/b], [b]building_major_capital[/b], [b]building_system_capital[/b] (regular empire capital upgrades), [b]building_hab_major_capital[/b] (the habitat capital upgrade - shared amongst all empire types), and [b]building_imperial_capital[/b] (the Galactic Imperium capital buildings for regular empires).

Although only loosely-related to this mod's main purpose, it also adds an event so that Aristocratic Elite empires begin with a Noble Estates building, as long as it does not already have one and there is room to add a building.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Compatible with any mod that does not overwrite the same buildings.  For mods that overwrite all the capital buildings, this mod's buildings will likely take precedence.  Might have problems with other mods that remove the expected colony types, but I highly doubt any mods do that.

Built for Stellaris version 3.6 "Orion."  Not compatible with achievements.

[h3]When to Install[/h3]
This mod can be safely added to your savegame after the game has started.  If you remove it, your game should function normally, although you will likely have Ruler Pops become unemployed as capital building jobs shift back to normal Politician jobs.  Always back up your savegame before trying to remove a mod.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
This mod overwrites five buildings, so expect to see five errors in your error.log similar to these:
